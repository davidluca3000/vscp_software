As with all work VSCP & Friends is built on work made by others.

First of all the people that built the wxWidgets toolset must be credited.
Without this excellent cross platform package this work has been impossible
to complete. Special thanks to Julian Smart, Robert Roebling

The people at Cesanta that built the Mongoose package which is used for much
of the communication code has made life a lot easier for a low resource
developer. This is an excellent package. A special thanks to Sergey Lyubka.

The Civetweb package is used for the web server code and for websockets. this
is work derived from Sergey Lyubka initial work with Mongoose when the code was
MIT licensed. It has since then had many improvements added. The VSCP & Friends
project forked this code. Special thanks to the secret <bel2125>
